# Proiect-final-BDD

This is my first project in automation testing I tested the https://automationexercise.com/ site.
 It's not covering all the functionalities or test cases from the site. It was tested a few functionalities and visual elements .
The code is in Python language, PyCharm IDE, Selenium API and BDD methodology implemented with Cucumber for Gherkin language.

To run the project, need to install the libraries from cmd file from my project.
